                <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>Where did Taco word come from?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Did you know that the word "taco" comes from the Mexican Spanish word "taco," which means "plug" or "wad"? The word was used to describe the pieces of paper that were wrapped around gunpowder and inserted into holes in the rock to blast out ore in silver mines. The word was later used to describe the pieces of paper that were wrapped around food to hold it together, and eventually came to refer to the food itself.

                    <summary>When did tacos become popular in the United States?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Tacos have been a popular food in the United States since the early 20th century. They were first introduced to the country by Mexican.
                        Jeffrey M. Pilcher, taco historian and professor of history at the University of Minnesota, has said that the first mention of tacos in the United States was in a <time datetime="1905"></time>1905 newspaper article about a Mexican taqueria in Los Angeles. The article described the tacos as "a Mexican dish made of meat, beans, and chili, wrapped in a tortilla."
